## 📈Project Overview
This project is centered around the development of an N-layer neural network to be tested on the MNIST dataset. Our goal was to explore and begin to understand the capabilities of neural networks with digit recognition capabilities while using the power of optimization algorithms and the high-performance computing capabilities of the Talapas supercomputer. 

## 🧑‍💻 Team Leadership & Collaboration
* Leadership
  Being the team lead, I was able to guide us through the design phases and oversee the project as a whole. I decided how we were going to implement the neural network, as well as what algorithms we would use.

* Network architecture
  Our network consists of N layers, but we found it performs best with 3 layers on the MNIST dataset. However, this can be changed upon request.

## 💡Research and Optimization
* Analyzing algorithms
  The main algorithm we chose to use was Stochastic Gradient Descent. We wanted to understand the behavior of SGD with OpenMP as well as our serial approach.

* Comparative analysis
  Our paper analyzes the different performance metrics of the parallel and serial implementations. We investigate the overall speed of the training cycle with different thread counts and compare it to the serial implementation without the use of OpenMP.
